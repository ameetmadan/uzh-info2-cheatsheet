# Preface

Welcome to the Informatics II Cheatsheet!

## What is this?

The Info-2 cheatsheet is intended to be a **non-exhaustive** collection of what you need to know about data structures and algorithms.

## How it works?

When the TAs and Tutors are preparing for the exercises, they will put some notes into this collection.

If you met some problems that you think is necessary to be added into this cheatsheet, do not hesitate to propose it in the issues, or create a merge requests. By doing so, you can not only revise and remember the stuff, but also help other students understand it. In this process, TAs and Tutors will revise what you proposed and check if they are correct and if they are needed to be added.
