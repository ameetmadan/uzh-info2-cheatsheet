# Compiler

**<u>Compile a Single Source File</u>**


```gcc simple.c -o simple.run```

Then we could run the executable file by ```./simple.run```.

* The filename is considered as the input file of our compiler. It is passed to the compiler without any parameters.
* The parameter `-o` specifies the output executable file name.
